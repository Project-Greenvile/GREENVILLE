        Greenville is an innovative waste management app designed to transform
        the way Lagos tackles waste disposal. Our mission is to create a
        cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable Lagos by harnessing the power
        of technology. At Greenville, we envision a Lagos where waste management
        is efficient, effective, and environmentally friendly. By achieving
        these goals, we believe EcoWaste can make a significant impact on the
        environment, public health, and the overall quality of life in Lagos.
        Join us in our mission to create a cleaner, greener, and more
        sustainable Lagos!
